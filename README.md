# Starter for deploying [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) models on [Render](https://oasis-or-blur.onrender.com/)
An image recognition model trained with Resnet50. Training data were collected from Google images(see fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders Lesson 2). I'm a big fan of British rock, so I choosed pics of Liam Gallagher and Noel Gallagher from Oasis, Damon Albarn from Blur to feed the model.
